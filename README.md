# music-theory-practice

A web-based music theory practice application for chord and accidental normalization.

## Live

- **Site**: [learning.lightbath.com](https://learning.lightbath.com)
- **App**: [learning.lightbath.com/practice](https://learning.lightbath.com/practice)

## Beta Testing

Currently in beta testing with students.

- NEW chord normalization with case-sensitive pattern matching
- NEW accidental normalization for double accidentals and mixed notation
- NEW comprehensive test framework with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+Q)
- FIX chord quality detection conflicts between m7 and M7
- TEST 100% pass rate for all normalization functions

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Learning Path Protection

**Before making any changes to the app, read the [Learning Path Protection Protocol](docs/LEARNING_PATH_PROTECTION.md).**

The learning path logic is working correctly and follows a predictable pattern:
- **Key progression**: C â†’ G â†’ D â†’ A â†’ E â†’ B â†’ F# â†’ C#
- **Chapter progression**: accCount â†’ accNotes â†’ scale â†’ triads â†’ sevenths
- **Special cases**: C major skips accNotes (intentional behavior)

**Any modifications to learning path logic require explicit permission and must follow the mandatory protocol.**

## Usage

- **Test Mode**: Press Ctrl+Shift+Q (Mac: Cmd+Shift+Q)
- **Version**: Displayed in top-right corner of app
- **Feedback**: Include version number when reporting issues

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fourhexagons/music-theory-practice.git
cd music-theory-practice
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000/practice
```

## Architecture

- `learning.lightbath.com` - Landing page (future: course marketing)
- `learning.lightbath.com/practice` - Music theory practice app
- `learning.lightbath.com/dashboard` - Future student dashboards

## Local Development: Running the Firebase Server

To ensure you never have multiple Firebase servers running at once (which can cause port conflicts and confusion), **always use the provided script**:

### Start or Restart the Server (Best Practice)

```sh
./serve-clean.sh
```

This script will:
- Kill any running `firebase serve` processes
- Start a new Firebase hosting server

### Why?
- Running multiple servers at once is a common source of bugs and confusion.
- This script guarantees only one server is running at a time.
- It works for both human developers and AI agents.

### First Time Setup
Make the script executable:
```sh
chmod +x serve-clean.sh
```

### Troubleshooting
- If you ever see errors about ports in use, or the site doesn't load as expected, run:
  ```sh
  ./serve-clean.sh
  ```
- If you want to check for running servers manually:
  ```sh
  ps aux | grep firebase
  ```
- To kill all running servers manually:
  ```sh
  pkill -f "firebase serve"
  ```

### Protocol for Agents and Developers
- **Always use `./serve-clean.sh` to start or restart the server.**
- Do not run `firebase serve` directly unless you are sure no other instance is running.
- This protocol should be followed by all agents and developers working on this project.
