## Code Investigation

### Execution Flow Mapping
*Trace from entry point to problem area*

**Entry Point:** `file:line` ‚Üí **Problem Area:** `file:line`

**Call Chain:**
1. `function/method` in `file:line`
2. `function/method` in `file:line`
3. `function/method` in `file:line`

### Component Analysis
*Examine each component in the flow*

**Component 1:** `ComponentName` in `file:line`
- **Purpose:** 
- **Logic:** 
- **Issues Found:** 

**Component 2:** `ComponentName` in `file:line`
- **Purpose:** 
- **Logic:** 
- **Issues Found:** 

### Search Commands Used
*Document searches for future reference*

```bash
# Semantic searches
codebase_search: "search query"

# Pattern searches  
grep_search: "pattern"

# File examination
read_file: "file:start-end"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Expected vs. Actual Logic
**Expected Behavior:**
- 

**Actual Implementation:**
- 

**Root Cause:**
- 

### Evidence
**Code References:**
- `file:line` - Description
- `file:line` - Description

## Solution Design

### Proposed Fix
**Target Changes:**
- [ ] `file:line` - What will change
- [ ] `file:line` - What will change

**Rationale:**
- 

### Consistency Check

## Methodology Reminders

üîç **Never assume** - always verify with actual code
üìã **Break it down** - complex problems ‚Üí specific questions  
üó∫Ô∏è **Map the flow** - trace execution from entry to problem
üìù **Document everything** - findings, rationale, evidence
üéØ **Fix the root cause** - not just symptoms
‚úÖ **Test thoroughly** - automated + manual + regression
