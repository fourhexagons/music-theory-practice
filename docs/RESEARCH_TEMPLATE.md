1. **Question 1:** 
   - [ ] Researched ‚úì 
   - **Finding:** 

2. **Question 2:** 
   - [ ] Researched ‚úì 
   - **Finding:** 

3. **Question 3:** 
   - [ ] Researched ‚úì 
   - **Finding:** 

## Code Investigation

### Execution Flow Mapping
*Trace from entry point to problem area*

**Entry Point:** `file:line` ‚Üí **Problem Area:** `file:line`

**Call Chain:**
1. `function/method` in `file:line`
2. `function/method` in `file:line`
3. `function/method` in `file:line`

### Component Analysis
*Examine each component in the flow*

**Component 1:** `ComponentName` in `file:line`
- **Purpose:** 
- **Logic:** 
- **Issues Found:** 

**Component 2:** `ComponentName` in `file:line`
- **Purpose:** 
- **Logic:** 
- **Issues Found:** 

### Search Commands Used
*Document searches for future reference*

```bash
# Semantic searches
codebase_search: "search query"

# Pattern searches  
grep_search: "pattern"

# File examination
read_file: "file:start-end"
```

## Methodology Reminders

üîç **Never assume** - always verify with actual code
üìã **Break it down** - complex problems ‚Üí specific questions  
üó∫Ô∏è **Map the flow** - trace execution from entry to problem
üìù **Document everything** - findings, rationale, evidence
üéØ **Fix the root cause** - not just symptoms
‚úÖ **Test thoroughly** - automated + manual + regression
