# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Music Theory Practice App! This guide will help you get started.

## üîç **MANDATORY: Systematic Research Methodology**

**ALL contributions involving existing code MUST follow our [Systematic Research Methodology](SYSTEMATIC_RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.md).**

### Before You Start ANY Task
1. **Use the [Research Template](RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md)** - Copy it and fill it out as you work
2. **Never make assumptions** - Always verify behavior through actual code
3. **Research systematically** - Break problems into specific questions and investigate each one
4. **Document your findings** - Capture evidence and reasoning for future contributors

### Why This Matters
This methodology successfully identified complex bugs that traditional approaches missed. It ensures:
- ‚úÖ **Root causes addressed** (not just symptoms)
- ‚úÖ **Architectural consistency maintained**
- ‚úÖ **No unintended side effects**
- ‚úÖ **Knowledge shared with team**

**Bottom line: Research first, contribute second. Always verify through code.**

- **Testing** - Add or improve tests
- **UI/UX improvements** - Enhance the user experience

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Set up the development environment** (see [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md))
4. **Create a feature branch** for your changes

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-theory-practice.git
cd music-theory-practice
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## üìù Development Workflow

### Before You Start
- **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
- **Discuss major changes** in an issue first
- **Read the existing code** to understand patterns

### Making Changes
1. **Follow systematic research methodology** - Use [Research Template](RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md)
2. **Research existing code** before making any modifications
3. **Make targeted changes** addressing root causes (not symptoms)
4. **Add tests** for new functionality
5. **Run the test suite** to ensure everything works
6. **Update documentation** with findings and rationale

### Testing Your Changes
```bash
# Start the development server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser and run tests
# Press Ctrl+Shift+Q (or Cmd+Shift+Q on Mac) to run tests
```

## üéØ Coding Standards

### JavaScript
- **Use consistent naming** (camelCase for variables/functions)
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
- **Validate inputs** thoroughly

### CSS
- **Use meaningful class names**
- **Keep styles modular**
- **Follow the existing design system**

### HTML
