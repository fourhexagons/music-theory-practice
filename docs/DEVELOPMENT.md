# Development Guide

## üîç **MANDATORY: Systematic Research Methodology**

**ALL development work involving existing code MUST follow the [Systematic Research Methodology](SYSTEMATIC_RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.md).**

### Quick Start
1. **Use the [Research Template](RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md)** for any task involving existing code
2. **Never make assumptions** - always verify with actual code first
3. **Research systematically** - break problems into specific questions and investigate each one
4. **Document findings** - capture evidence and reasoning for future reference

### Why This Matters
This methodology successfully identified and fixed complex bugs that traditional debugging missed:
- Architecture conflicts between old and new systems
- Test configuration issues masking real problems  
- Root cause vs. symptom confusion
- Integration points that weren't obvious

**Bottom line: Research first, implement second. Always verify through code.**

## üö® CRITICAL: LEARNING PATH LOGIC PROTECTION PROTOCOL üö®

**BEFORE making ANY changes to learning path logic, you MUST follow this protocol:**

### Step 1: STOP and READ
If you're about to modify any of these files/functions, STOP immediately:
- `src/state/learningState.js` - `advanceLearningPath()` function
- `src/modules/business/services/StateManager.js` - `getCurrentChapter()` function  
- `src/modules/business/services/StateManager.js` - `getCurrentKey()` function
- `src/modules/business/services/StateManager.js` - `getCurrentGroup()` function
- `src/modules/business/services/QuestionGenerator.js` - Question generation logic
- Any file containing learning path progression logic

### Step 2: ASK PERMISSION
**You MUST ask the user explicitly:**
> "I'm about to modify the learning path logic in [specific file/function]. This could break the app's progression. Do you want me to proceed, or should I find an alternative solution?"

### Step 3: ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS FIRST
Before modifying learning path logic, consider these alternatives:
- **UI/UX changes**: Modify the interface, not the logic
- **Question generation**: Change how questions are asked, not how progression works
- **Validation logic**: Modify answer checking, not progression
- **State display**: Change how progress is shown, not how it's tracked
- **Error handling**: Improve error messages, not core logic

### Step 4: IF PERMISSION GRANTED
- Create a backup branch first: `git checkout -b backup-learning-path-[date]`
- Make minimal, targeted changes only
- Test thoroughly before committing
- Document exactly what was changed and why

### Step 5: REMEMBER
The learning path logic is **WORKING CORRECTLY** and follows a predictable pattern:
- C major ‚Üí G major ‚Üí D major ‚Üí A major ‚Üí E major ‚Üí B major ‚Üí F# major ‚Üí C# major
- Each key: accCount ‚Üí accNotes ‚Üí scale ‚Üí triads ‚Üí sevenths
- C major skips accNotes (intentional behavior)
- Triads/sevenths require 3 correct answers, others advance immediately

**This protocol is MANDATORY for all assistants and developers.**

## üîç SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL: This is how we should approach ALL debugging problems. Perspective is everything!**

### The Problem with Narrow Perspectives
Assistants often make their biggest mistakes when they:
- Assume they understand the problem immediately
- Jump to conclusions without thorough investigation
- Focus on the first potential solution they see
- Ignore alternative explanations or root causes

### The Systematic Approach (Proven Method)

#### Step 1: STOP and INVESTIGATE
**DO NOT** start coding immediately. Instead:

1. **Examine the complete codebase evolution**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -15  # See recent commits
   git show <commit-hash> --name-only  # See what files changed
   ```

2. **Understand the baseline (working state)**
   - Find the last known working commit
   - Examine what the code looked like before the problem
   - Understand the original design intent

3. **Trace the problem's introduction**
   - Look at each commit that might have introduced the issue
   - Compare before/after states
   - Identify what changed and why

#### Step 2: CONSIDER MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES
**DO NOT** assume you have the complete picture. Ask:

1. **Where else could this problem be occurring?**
   - Search the entire codebase for similar patterns
   - Look for multiple places where the same logic might be applied
   - Consider different execution paths

2. **What are the alternative explanations?**
   - Could the problem be in a different function?
   - Could it be a data structure issue?
   - Could it be a timing/initialization problem?

3. **What are the edge cases?**
   - Different modes of operation
   - Different user flows
   - Different data states

#### Step 3: CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
**DO NOT** proceed without a complete plan:

1. **Document your understanding**
   - Write down what you think the problem is
   - List all the places you've investigated
   - Note any assumptions you're making

2. **Test your assumptions**
   - Verify each piece of your understanding
   - Look for evidence that contradicts your theory
   - Consider what would disprove your hypothesis

3. **Plan the complete solution**
   - Address all identified root causes
   - Ensure no new problems are introduced
   - Plan how to verify the fix works

#### Step 4: IMPLEMENT CAREFULLY
**DO NOT** make changes until you're certain:

1. **Make minimal, targeted changes**
   - Change only what's necessary
   - Preserve working functionality
   - Document what you're changing and why

2. **Test thoroughly**
   - Test the specific issue
   - Test related functionality
   - Test edge cases

3. **Verify the fix**
   - Confirm the problem is resolved
   - Ensure no regressions
   - Document the solution

### Real Example: Seventh Chord Key Mismatch Issue

**Problem**: Keys shown in question text didn't match keys used in validation for seventh chord spelling questions.

**Initial Assumption**: The problem was in the main `askQuestion()` function.

**Systematic Investigation**:

1. **Examined code evolution**:
   - Found the "original fix" commit that introduced special handling
   - Compared before/after states of `askQuestion()` function
   - Identified that the special handling was unnecessary

2. **Considered multiple perspectives**:
   - Checked if the problem occurred in normal learning path vs advanced practice
   - Found that `startAdvancedPractice()` had multiple random key selections
   - Discovered the real root cause was inconsistent key selection

3. **Created comprehensive plan**:
   - Revert unnecessary special handling in `askQuestion()`
   - Fix key selection consistency in `startAdvancedPractice()`
   - Ensure validation logic remains correct

4. **Implemented carefully**:
   - Made minimal changes to restore original working behavior
   - Fixed the actual root cause (multiple random selections)
   - Verified the fix resolved the issue

**Result**: Complete resolution of the key mismatch issue with no regressions.

### Key Lessons

1. **Never assume you understand the problem immediately**
2. **Always investigate the complete codebase evolution**
3. **Consider multiple execution paths and edge cases**
4. **Look for patterns that might indicate broader issues**
5. **Make minimal, targeted changes based on thorough understanding**
6. **Document your process for future reference**

**This systematic approach prevents the most common debugging mistakes and leads to more reliable solutions.**

## üîç **Evidence-Based Debugging: Direct System Observation**

**BREAKTHROUGH PRINCIPLE: Debug what the system actually does, not what you think it should do.**

### The Universal Debugging Philosophy

Most debugging failures occur when developers debug **theoretical system behavior** instead of **actual system behavior**. The key breakthrough is to **observe the system directly** and let the evidence guide your investigation.

#### Core Principle
**"If you can't observe it happening, question whether it's actually happening."**

### Universal Observation Techniques

#### 1. **Execution Tracing** 
**Method**: Add logging/breakpoints to observe actual code execution paths

**Applications**:
- **JavaScript**: `console.log()` statements at key decision points
- **Network**: Browser DevTools Network tab to see actual requests/responses
- **CSS**: Computed styles to see what styles are actually applied
- **State Management**: Log state changes before/after critical operations

**Key Insight**: **When expected logs don't appear, that's meaningful evidence.**

#### 2. **State Inspection**
**Method**: Capture and examine actual system state at critical moments

**Applications**:
- **Variables/Objects**: Log actual values, not assumed values
- **Database**: Query actual data, don't assume schema
- **File System**: Check actual file contents, permissions, paths
- **Configuration**: Verify actual config values, not default assumptions

#### 3. **Flow Analysis** 
**Method**: Trace data/control flow through the actual system

**Applications**:
- **Function Calls**: Map the actual call chain, not the expected one
- **Event Handling**: Log event triggers and handlers
- **Data Transformations**: Track data changes at each step
- **Integration Points**: Verify actual communication between components

#### 4. **Negative Evidence** ("Follow the Silence")
**Method**: Use absence of expected behavior as critical debugging data

**Applications**:
- **Missing Logs**: If you expect a function to run but see no logs, it's not running
- **Silent Failures**: When something should happen but doesn't, investigate why
- **Unexpected Paths**: When flow goes where you didn't expect, trace why

### üéØ **Case Study: Random Sevenths Key Randomization Bug**

**Problem**: "Spelling Sevenths" menu option stuck on C major, not randomizing across all keys.

#### Traditional Debugging Approach (Failed)
1. **Assumed** the issue was in `startAdvancedPractice()` function conflicts
2. **Theorized** about function overrides and call precedence  
3. **Implemented** theoretical fixes without validation
4. **Assumed** fixes worked without observing actual behavior

#### Evidence-Based Approach (Successful)

**Step 1: Observe Actual System Behavior**
```
Console Evidence:
AnswerValidator.js:19 üîç Answer Validation: {userAnswer: 'f a c e', key: 'C', chapterId: 'seventhSpelling', degree: 4}
AnswerValidator.js:19 üîç Answer Validation: {userAnswer: 'a c e g', key: 'C', chapterId: 'seventhSpelling', degree: 6}
```

**Critical Discovery**: Questions consistently generated with `key: 'C'` - **hard evidence** of the bug.

**Step 2: Follow the Evidence Trail**
- **AnswerValidator** logs showed `key: 'C'` consistently
- **Traced backwards**: AnswerValidator ‚Üê QuestionGenerator ‚Üê StateManager ‚Üê `getCurrentKey()`
- **Added debugging** to suspected functions: `startAdvancedPractice()`

**Step 3: "Follow the Silence"**
```javascript
// Added debugging to both potential startAdvancedPractice functions
console.log('üîç EVIDENCE: startAdvancedPractice called with mode:', mode);
```

**Critical Evidence**: **NO debugging logs appeared** from `startAdvancedPractice` functions.

**Step 4: Challenge Initial Assumptions** 
- **Wrong Assumption**: "Spelling Sevenths" uses `startAdvancedPractice()`
- **Evidence Reality**: No `startAdvancedPractice()` logs = different execution path
- **New Investigation**: Traced actual execution through `QuestionGenerator` ‚Üí `StateManager.getCurrentKey()`

**Step 5: Root Cause Discovery**
Found actual key selection in `getCurrentKey()`:
```javascript
// BROKEN: 'spelling_sevenths' mode not included in randomization condition
if (mode === window.MODES.NAMING_TRIADS || mode.startsWith('advanced')) {
    return group.keys[Math.floor(Math.random() * group.keys.length)];
}
return group.keys[learningState.currentKeyIndex]; // Always index 0 = 'C'
```

**Step 6: Evidence-Based Fix**
```javascript
// FIXED: Added missing mode to randomization condition  
if (mode === window.MODES.NAMING_TRIADS || mode.startsWith('advanced') || mode === 'spelling_sevenths') {
    return group.keys[Math.floor(Math.random() * group.keys.length)];
}
```

#### Key Lessons

1. **Console logs are hard evidence** - more reliable than code assumptions
2. **Absence of expected evidence is data** - silence revealed wrong execution path  
3. **Trace backwards from observable effects** - AnswerValidator ‚Üí root cause
4. **Challenge every assumption** with direct observation
5. **Simple bugs hide in complex systems** - missing condition in if-statement

### Universal Application Template

#### Before Any Debugging Session:
1. **Define Observable Evidence**: What logs/outputs should you see if the system works correctly?
2. **Add Instrumentation**: Place logging/breakpoints at key decision points
3. **Run and Observe**: Execute the scenario and collect actual evidence
4. **Compare Expected vs. Actual**: Note discrepancies between expected and observed behavior

#### During Investigation:
1. **Trust the Evidence**: If logs say X, believe X (not your assumptions)
2. **Follow Missing Evidence**: When expected behavior doesn't occur, investigate why
3. **Trace Execution Paths**: Map the actual flow, not the intended flow
4. **Question Everything**: Challenge assumptions at each step

#### Key Questions to Ask:
- **"What evidence should I see if this is working correctly?"**
- **"Why am I not seeing the evidence I expected?"**
- **"What is the system actually doing vs. what I think it's doing?"**
- **"Where can I observe this behavior directly?"**

### Tools for Direct Observation

#### JavaScript/Frontend
- **Console logging**: `console.log()`, `console.table()`, `console.group()`
- **Browser DevTools**: Network, Elements, Sources, Performance tabs
- **Breakpoints**: Debugger statements and IDE breakpoints
- **State inspection**: React DevTools, Vue DevTools, Redux DevTools

#### Backend/Systems
- **Application logs**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Database logs**: Query execution plans and performance logs
- **Network analysis**: Packet capture, API response inspection  
- **System monitoring**: Resource usage, process states

#### Development Environment
- **Build processes**: Compilation logs, bundle analysis
- **Test output**: Detailed test failure information
- **Server logs**: Development server request/response cycles
- **File system**: Actual file contents, permissions, timestamps

### When to Apply This Approach

**Always Apply For:**
- **Intermittent bugs** that are hard to reproduce
- **Performance issues** where theoretical analysis isn't sufficient
- **Integration problems** between components or systems
- **Complex state management** issues

**Especially Critical For:**
- **"It should work but doesn't"** scenarios
- **Assumptions about third-party behavior** (APIs, libraries, frameworks)
- **Multi-step processes** with unclear failure points
- **Legacy code** where documentation might be outdated

**Remember**: The system is always telling you what it's doing. The key is learning how to listen to it effectively.

## üìù **MANDATORY: Documentation Maintenance Protocol**

**Just like systematic research is mandatory, [Documentation Maintenance](DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_PROTOCOL.md) is mandatory for ALL development work.**

### **Documentation is Part of Every Change**
- ‚úÖ **Document as you research** - Capture findings in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Document as you build** - Update guides as you implement  
- ‚úÖ **Document before you commit** - Documentation quality blocks merge

### **Quick Documentation Checklist**
Before committing ANY change:
- [ ] **Research findings captured** for future developers
- [ ] **Decision rationale documented** with evidence
- [ ] **Code documentation updated** (comments, README, etc.)
- [ ] **User guides updated** if behavior changed
- [ ] **Examples verified** to still work correctly

**See [Documentation Maintenance Protocol](DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_PROTOCOL.md) for complete requirements.**
