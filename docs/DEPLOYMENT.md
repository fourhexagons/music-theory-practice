## üö® **CRITICAL: Deployment Protection Protocol**

### **üõë MANDATORY STAGING-FIRST DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL**

**ASSISTANTS MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT SEQUENCE - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

1. **Deploy to staging FIRST**: `npm run deploy:staging`
2. **Inform user**: "I've deployed to staging: https://staging.learning.lightbath.com/practice"
3. **Wait for manual testing**: User will test the staging site themselves
4. **Ask for explicit permission**: "Should I deploy this to production?"
5. **Only deploy to production after receiving explicit approval**: "yes", "deploy", or "proceed"

### **üö® ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**
- **NEVER deploy directly to production** without staging first
- **NEVER deploy to production** without explicit user approval after staging test
- **NEVER assume** staging test was successful - wait for user confirmation
- **NEVER proceed** with production deployment if user says "let me test" or "wait"

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FAILURE WARNING:**
**ANY deployment to production without following this exact protocol is a CRITICAL FAILURE. The user has been burned multiple times by hasty deployments that broke the live site.**

## üìã **Complete Deployment Process**

### **Current Working Method (Recommended)**

#### **1. Build for Production**
```bash
npm run build
```

**What This Does:**
- Builds using Vite with production optimizations
- Creates `dist/` directory with bundled assets
- Generates hashed filenames for cache-busting (e.g., `practice.Cxh6_bIJ.js`)
- Copies essential files from `public-clean/` (favicon, icons, images)
- Creates clean URLs by copying `dist/src/practice.html` to `dist/practice.html`
- Includes file existence checks to prevent deployment failures

#### **2. Manual Deployment (Current Reliable Method)**
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**What This Does:**
- Deploys `dist/` directory to Firebase hosting
- Updates live site at `https://music-theory-practice-01.web.app`
- Updates custom domain at `https://learning.lightbath.com`
- Includes service worker with clean asset caching (no legacy conflicts)

#### **3. Verification**
**Live Site URLs:**
- **Main Practice App**: `https://learning.lightbath.com/practice`
- **Landing Page**: `https://learning.lightbath.com/`
- **Firebase URL**: `https://music-theory-practice-01.web.app/practice`

## üèóÔ∏è **Build Process Details**

### **Current Architecture (Post-Fix)**
- **Source**: `src/` directory (modern modular system)
- **Build Output**: `dist/` directory
- **Static Assets**: `public-clean/` directory (clean, essential files only)
- **Service Worker**: Vite PWA plugin generates optimized caching

### **Key Build Process Changes (Recent Fix)**
1. **Clean Public Directory**: Uses `public-clean/` instead of `public/`
2. **No Legacy Conflicts**: Eliminates old files that caused service worker conflicts
3. **Optimized Caching**: Service worker caches ~34 entries instead of 57
4. **Asset Hashing**: Proper cache-busting with hashed filenames

### **Service Worker Behavior (Fixed)**
- **Before Fix**: Cached 57 entries (501.88 KiB) including legacy conflicts
- **After Fix**: Caches 34 entries (317.40 KiB) with clean modern assets only
- **Result**: No more 404 errors for missing assets

## üîß **Build Configuration**

### **Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)**
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    emptyOutDir: true,
    // ... other build settings
  },
  publicDir: 'public-clean', // Clean static assets only
  // ... PWA and other plugins
})
```

### **Firebase Configuration (`firebase.json`)**
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "/practice",
        "destination": "/practice.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Package.json Build Script**
```json
{
  "build": "vite build && test -f dist/src/index.html && test -f dist/src/practice.html && cp dist/src/index.html dist/index.html && cp dist/src/practice.html dist/practice.html"
}
```

## üö® **GitHub Actions Deployment Status**

### **Current Status: Manual Deployment Preferred**
- **‚úÖ Manual Deployment**: Working reliably (`firebase deploy --only hosting`)
- **‚ùå GitHub Actions**: Service account authentication issues
- **‚úÖ Build Process**: Fully compatible with CI/CD (includes file existence checks)

### **GitHub Actions Configuration**
**Files:**
- `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml`
- `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml`

**Known Issue:**
- Service account secret `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MUSIC_THEORY_PRACTICE_01` needs verification
- Node.js 20 compatibility confirmed (previously fixed)

**Resolution Path** (when needed):
1. Check GitHub repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Verify service account secret exists and is valid
3. If missing, generate new Firebase service account key
4. Test with a small deployment

## üîç **Deployment Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **1. Service Worker Cache Conflicts**
**Symptoms:**
- 404 errors for JavaScript assets with specific hashes
- Old cached content serving instead of new deployment
- Mobile browsers showing different content than desktop

**Root Cause:**
- Mixed legacy and modern build artifacts
- Service worker caching old files

**Solution:**
- **Fixed**: Using `public-clean/` directory eliminates legacy conflicts
- **Verification**: Check service worker cache size (~34 entries is correct)

#### **2. Asset 404 Errors**
**Symptoms:**
- Missing JavaScript files like `practice.BXPz9h1l.js`
- Console errors on live site

**Root Cause:**
- Build/deployment mismatch
- Service worker serving outdated asset references

**Solution:**
- **Fixed**: Clean build process with proper asset hashing
- **Verification**: Check `dist/assets/` contains correctly hashed files

#### **3. Favicon/Logo Missing**
**Symptoms:**
- Favicon 404 errors in dev environment
- Logo images not loading

**Root Cause:**
- Static assets not properly included in build

**Solution:**
- **Fixed**: `public-clean/` directory includes essential static files
- **Verification**: Check `dist/favicon.ico` and `dist/images/` exist

#### **4. Mobile Browser Caching**
**Symptoms:**
- Desktop works after hard refresh, mobile doesn't
- Private/incognito mode works, regular browsing doesn't

**Root Cause:**
- Aggressive service worker caching on mobile
- Old cached assets still being served

**Solution:**
- **Fixed**: Clean service worker with proper cache versioning
- **User Action**: Clear browser cache or use private browsing temporarily

## ‚úÖ **Quick Reference Commands**

### **Standard Deployment Workflow**

#### **MANDATORY: Staging-First Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Build for production
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to staging FIRST (mandatory)
npm run deploy:staging

# 3. Inform user and wait for manual testing
# "I've deployed to staging: https://staging.learning.lightbath.com/practice"

# 4. Ask for explicit permission after user tests
# "Should I deploy this to production?"

# 5. Deploy to production ONLY after explicit approval
npm run deploy:production
```

#### **Emergency Revert (Production Issues)**
```bash
# 1. Immediately revert code
git revert HEAD

# 2. Deploy revert to production
npm run deploy:production

# 3. Fix issue on staging first
npm run deploy:staging
# Test thoroughly, get approval, then deploy to production
```

#### **For Staging-Only Testing**
```bash
# 1. Build for production
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# 3. Test on staging
# Visit https://staging.learning.lightbath.com/practice
```

### **Troubleshooting Commands**
```bash
# Check build output
ls -la dist/
ls -la dist/assets/

# Check service worker
# (DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers)

# Clean development environment
npm run dev
```
