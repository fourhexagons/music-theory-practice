# Technical To-Dos & Infrastructure Issues

## üéØ ASSISTANT HANDOFF

**CONTEXT**: Music theory practice app deployment fully operational. All major deployment issues resolved.

**CURRENT STATUS**:
‚úÖ Live site: https://learning.lightbath.com/practice (fully functional)
‚úÖ Local dev: npm run dev ‚Üí http://localhost:5173/practice 
‚úÖ Manual deployment: firebase deploy --only hosting (reliable & working)
‚úÖ Build process: Clean service worker caching, no legacy conflicts
‚úÖ Service worker: Optimized from 57 to 34 entries, no 404 errors
‚úÖ Development environment: Favicon and assets loading properly
‚úÖ Git state: Clean, main branch, all changes committed

**RECENT MAJOR WORK COMPLETED**:
- ‚úÖ **Service Worker Cache Conflicts**: Fixed via clean build process with public-clean/
- ‚úÖ **Live Site 404 Errors**: Resolved asset conflicts, proper cache management
- ‚úÖ **Development Environment**: Fixed favicon 404s, logo loading issues
- ‚úÖ **Build Process**: Optimized with no legacy file pollution
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Created comprehensive deployment guide (docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)

**DEPLOYMENT PROCESS**: See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment guide.

**CRITICAL PROTOCOLS**:
1. READ ALL DOCS: Must follow docs/SYSTEMATIC_RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.md
2. VERIFY ENVIRONMENT: npm run verify-dev-env (should pass)
3. VERIFY GIT: npm run git:verify (should show clean state)
4. NO ASSUMPTIONS: Evidence-based investigation only

**WORKING COMMANDS**:
- npm run dev (development server, port 5173)
- firebase deploy --only hosting (manual deployment)
- npm run build (production build - works perfectly)

This file tracks technical debt, infrastructure improvements, and development tooling issues that need attention but are not blocking core functionality.

## üö® Active Issues

### GitHub Actions Deployment Pipeline (Non-Blocking)
**Status**: Manual deployment working reliably  
**Priority**: Low  
**Description**: GitHub Actions automatic deployment has service account authentication issues, but manual deployment works perfectly.

**Current Situation**:
- ‚úÖ **Manual deployment**: Reliable via `firebase deploy --only hosting`
- ‚úÖ **Build process**: Fully functional with optimized service worker
- ‚ùå **GitHub Actions**: Service account secret may need verification
- ‚úÖ **Workaround**: Manual deployment is fast and reliable

**Resolution Path** (when convenient):
1. Check GitHub repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Verify `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MUSIC_THEORY_PRACTICE_01` exists and is valid
3. If needed, generate new Firebase service account key

**Files Involved**:
- `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml`
- `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml`

**Note**: This is not blocking development or deployment. Manual deployment is working perfectly and is actually faster than waiting for GitHub Actions.

## üìã Future Technical Improvements

### Package.json Cleanup
**Status**: Identified  
**Priority**: Low  
**Description**: Remove unused scripts and fix broken script references in package.json

**Details**:
- Several scripts reference non-existent files (analyze-css.js, analyze-performance.js, profile-build.js)
- `phase2:complete` script may be obsolete
- General cleanup needed for maintainability

## üîÑ Completed Items

### Service Worker Cache Conflicts Resolution
**Completed**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Service worker caching legacy files causing 404 errors for assets  
**Root Cause**: Mixed legacy and modern build artifacts, service worker caching everything  
**Solution**: Clean build process with `public-clean/` directory, optimized service worker  
**Result**: Reduced cache from 57 to 34 entries, eliminated 404 errors, clean deployment

### Development Environment Favicon Issues
**Completed**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Favicon 404 errors in development, logo images not loading  
**Root Cause**: Static assets not properly served when `publicDir` was disabled  
**Solution**: Created `public-clean/` directory with essential assets, updated Vite config  
**Result**: Clean development environment with proper asset loading

### Build Process Optimization
**Completed**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Build process including legacy files causing deployment conflicts  
**Root Cause**: Vite copying entire `public/` directory including old legacy files  
**Solution**: Configured Vite to use `public-clean/` with only essential static assets  
**Result**: Clean builds with no legacy file pollution, optimized service worker

### Live Site 404 Resolution
**Completed**: July 2, 2025  
**Issue**: Live site returning 404 for all routes  
**Root Cause**: GitHub Actions build failure + deployment pipeline issues  
**Solution**: Manual Firebase deployment + build process fixes  
**Result**: Site fully functional with all recent improvements live

### Documentation Version References
**Completed**: July 2, 2025  
**Issue**: Hard-coded version numbers in documentation creating maintenance burden  
**Solution**: Removed version references from all docs files  
**Result**: Cleaner, more maintainable documentation

### Deployment Documentation Organization
**Completed**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Deployment information scattered across multiple files  
**Root Cause**: No centralized deployment guide for assistants  
**Solution**: Created comprehensive `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` consolidating all deployment info  
**Result**: Assistants can easily find complete deployment process and troubleshooting
