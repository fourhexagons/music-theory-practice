# Music Theory Practice - Complete Learning Path Documentation

## Overview

This document shows the **exact** question and answer pairs that a user encounters when progressing through the complete learning path from "Start Over" to completion.

**Important Notes:**
- **LINEAR mode**: One question per chapter, but triads require 3 correct answers per key before advancing
- **RANDOM_KEYS_LINEAR_CHAPTERS mode**: Maintains linear chapter progression but randomizes keys  
- **RANDOM_ALL mode**: Completely random questions from available chapters/keys
- **C major special handling**: accNotes (accidentals naming) is skipped because C major has 0 accidentals
- **Triads use degrees 2-7**: Never asks for the 1st degree (tonic triad)

---

## Level 1: Introduction
**Keys:** C  
**Mode:** LINEAR  
**Chapters:** accCount → accNotes → scale → triads  
**Required Streak:** 3 (each question advances immediately, except triads need 3 correct)

### Question Sequence:

**Q1-3:** C Major Progression
1. **Q1:** "How many accidentals are in C major?" → **Answer:** `0`

## Technical Notes

**Answer Formats:**
- **Accidentals Count:** Single number (e.g., `3`)
- **Accidentals Names:** Space-separated notes (e.g., `F# C# G#`)
- **Scale Spelling:** Space-separated notes (e.g., `C D E F G A B`)
- **Triads:** Chord symbol (e.g., `Em`, `F#°`)
- **Sevenths:** Chord symbol with 7th (e.g., `Dmaj7`, `Am7`)
- **Seventh Spelling:** Space-separated notes (e.g., `D F# A C#`)

**Degree System:**
- Uses ordinal function: 2 → "2nd", 3 → "3rd", 4 → "4th", etc.
- Never asks for 1st degree in chord questions
- Randomizes unused degrees from [2,3,4,5,6,7] pool
