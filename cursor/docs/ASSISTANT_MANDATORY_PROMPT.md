# Assistant Mandatory Prompt (Copy-Paste for Cursor)

Use this prompt when working with assistants to ensure they read documentation before any investigation:

---

üõë **STOP - MANDATORY PROCESS BEFORE ANY INVESTIGATION**

Before you investigate ANY code or suggest ANY solutions:

1. **COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION REVIEW**
   READ EVERY FILE in docs/ COMPLETELY:
   - docs/SYSTEMATIC_RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.md
   - docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_PROTOCOL.md  
   - docs/RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md
   - docs/DEVELOPMENT.md
   - docs/URL_CONFIGURATION.md
   - docs/LEARNING_PATH_PROTECTION.md
   - ALL other docs/ files

2. **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** 
   Respond: "I have read all documentation in docs/ completely and understand the methodology."

3. **ENVIRONMENT SETUP PHASE**
   Respond: "I am now setting up my development environment according to documented protocols."

4. **COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION**
   You MUST run and report results:
   - Command: `npm run verify-dev-env`
   - Paste the complete output (success or failure)
   - State: "Environment verification complete" (only if verification passes)

5. **GIT WORKFLOW VERIFICATION**
   You MUST run and report results:
   - Command: `npm run git:verify`
   - Paste the complete output showing git state analysis
   - Follow any automated workflow recommendations
   - State: "Git workflow verified" (only after reviewing output)

6. **INVESTIGATION PERMISSION**
   Only after steps 1-5, respond: "All protocols verified. I am ready to begin systematic investigation."

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Steps 2-6 must be separate responses. No investigation may begin until step 6 is completed.

üéØ **WHY**: Previous assistants who skipped doc reading wasted hours on wrong assumptions, broke working code, and violated critical protocols. Reading docs first prevents this and leads to faster, correct solutions.

**Your next response should ONLY be confirmation that you've read all docs, nothing else.**
