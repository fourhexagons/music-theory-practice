# Assistant Mandatory Prompt (Copy-Paste for Cursor)

Use this prompt when working with assistants to ensure they read documentation before any investigation:

---

üõë **STOP - MANDATORY PROCESS BEFORE ANY INVESTIGATION**

Before you investigate ANY code or suggest ANY solutions:

1. **READ EVERY FILE in docs/ COMPLETELY** 
   - docs/SYSTEMATIC_RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.md
   - docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_PROTOCOL.md  
   - docs/RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md
   - docs/DEVELOPMENT.md
   - docs/URL_CONFIGURATION.md
   - docs/LEARNING_PATH_PROTECTION.md
   - ALL other docs/ files

2. **CONFIRM YOUR READING** by responding: "I have read all documentation in docs/ completely and understand the methodology."

3. **ONLY THEN** may you begin investigation.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Any investigation, code examination, or solution suggestions made WITHOUT first reading all docs completely will be rejected and you'll be asked to restart from step 1.

üéØ **WHY**: Previous assistants who skipped doc reading wasted hours on wrong assumptions, broke working code, and violated critical protocols. Reading docs first prevents this and leads to faster, correct solutions.

**Your next response should ONLY be confirmation that you've read all docs, nothing else.**
