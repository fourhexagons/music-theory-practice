# Development Protocol: Iterative Testing & Solving

**Last Updated:** June 25, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Proven Effective - App Successfully Restored

## üéØ Protocol Overview

This protocol was successfully used to restore the music theory practice app from a broken state to full functionality. The iterative approach of testing ‚Üí identifying issues ‚Üí solving ‚Üí testing again proved highly effective.

## üîÑ Core Process

### Phase 1: Investigation & Understanding
1. **Analyze the codebase structure** - Understand the app's purpose and architecture
2. **Identify the broken state** - Document what's not working and why
3. **Locate working reference** - Find a known good state (e.g., `origin/main`)
4. **Understand the intended functionality** - Know what the app should do

### Phase 2: Systematic Restoration
1. **Restore core files** - Replace broken files with working versions
2. **Verify dependencies** - Ensure all required files and functions exist
3. **Check data integrity** - Confirm quiz data and learning paths are correct
4. **Test core functionality** - Verify basic app operations

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing
1. **Create targeted test files** - Build specific tests for different components
2. **Run existing test suites** - Verify all existing tests pass
3. **Simulate user workflows** - Test complete user sessions
4. **Iterate until stable** - Continue testing and fixing until everything works

## üõ† Tools & Techniques Used

### Testing Tools
- **Browser-based tests** - No build process required, immediate feedback
- **Console logging** - Debug state changes and function calls
- **Step-by-step simulation** - Test complete user workflows
- **Component isolation** - Test individual functions and modules

### Problem-Solving Techniques
- **Git state comparison** - Compare broken vs working versions
- **Function dependency tracing** - Track missing or broken function calls
- **State management verification** - Ensure learning state is properly managed
- **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, add complexity gradually

## üìã Specific Steps That Worked

### 1. State Analysis
```bash
# Check current git state
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Compare with working state
git checkout origin/main
git checkout test-suite-reorg
```

### 2. File Restoration
```bash
# Restore working files from known good state
git checkout origin/main -- public/js/main.js
git checkout origin/main -- public/practice.html
```

### 3. Dependency Verification
```bash
# Check if required functions exist
grep_search "functionName" --include-pattern "*.js"
# Verify script loading order in HTML
```

### 4. Testing Strategy
```bash
# Start development server
firebase serve --only hosting

# Test core functionality
open http://localhost:5000/practice
open http://localhost:5000/tests/index.html

# Create targeted tests
# - test_app_functionality.html
# - test_quiz_progression.html  
# - test_complete_workflow.html
```

## ‚úÖ Success Metrics

- [x] Question generation works correctly
- [x] Answer validation functions properly
- [x] Learning progression advances as intended
- [x] UI displays questions and accepts input
- [x] Advanced practice modes work
- [x] All test suites pass

### Code Quality Maintained

- [x] All functions properly defined and accessible
- [x] State management is consistent
- [x] Data integrity preserved

## üîß Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Iterative approach** - Test ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Fix
2. **Comprehensive testing** - Multiple test types for different aspects
3. **State comparison** - Using git to compare working vs broken states
4. **Progressive restoration** - Fix one issue at a time
5. **User workflow simulation** - Test complete user sessions

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Missing function calls** - Add `window.` prefix for global functions
2. **Broken dependencies** - Restore complete working files, not partial fixes
3. **State management issues** - Ensure learning state is properly initialized
4. **Script loading order** - Verify dependencies load before main logic

## üïµÔ∏è UI/UX Debugging Protocol & Checklist

When debugging UI/UX or state issues, always use a systematic, broad-to-narrow approach to avoid tunnel vision and ensure all possible causes are considered:

### 1. Start with a Broad Hypothesis
- Restate the problem in plain language.
- List all possible layers involved: HTML, CSS, JS, browser behavior, event order, etc.
- Ask: Could this be a CSS issue? A JS logic issue? A browser default? A markup/semantics issue?

### 2. Use a Systematic Debugging Checklist
- **HTML/markup:** Is the structure and semantics correct?
- **CSS:** Are there conflicting rules, pseudo-classes, or specificity issues?
- **JS:** Is the state being set and updated as expected? Are events firing in the right order?
- **Browser behavior:** Are there default actions (focus, navigation, etc.) interfering?
- **Event order:** Are there race conditions or timing issues?

### 3. Reproduce and Isolate
- Try to reproduce the bug in the simplest way possible.
- Isolate the problem: Remove or comment out unrelated code to see if the bug persists.

### 4. Audit for Interconnectivity
- Check for side effects: Could a change in one area (e.g., JS) be undone by another (e.g., CSS)?
- Look for resets or global styles that might override local rules.

### 5. Use the "Last Mile" Principle
- If a fix doesn't work, don't just try another similar fix‚Äîstep back and re-audit the entire stack.
- Ask: What am I assuming that might not be true?

### 6. Communicate and Summarize
- Summarize findings and next steps at each stage.
- Ask for user input if a decision point is reached or if the bug is ambiguous.

### 7. Confirm with Evidence
- After each fix, confirm with a clear test or evidence that the bug is resolved.
- If not, return to step 1 and broaden the scope again.

**Protocol Reminder:** If you notice the debugging process is getting too focused or missing the big picture, do a "protocol check" and step back to re-audit all layers.

## üöÄ Future Development Guidelines

### Before Making Changes
1. **Create feature branch** - Never work directly on main
2. **Document current state** - Know what's working before changes
3. **Plan testing strategy** - How will you verify the changes work?

### During Development
1. **Test frequently** - Don't wait until the end to test
2. **Use console logging** - Debug state changes and function calls
3. **Create targeted tests** - Test specific functionality as you build it
4. **Commit working states** - Save progress regularly

### After Changes
1. **Run comprehensive tests** - All existing tests + new functionality tests
2. **Simulate user workflows** - Test complete user sessions
3. **Verify no regressions** - Ensure existing functionality still works
4. **Document changes** - Update this protocol if new techniques are discovered

## üìö Test File Templates

### Basic Functionality Test
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Functionality Test</title></head>
<body>
    <div id="results"></div>
    <script src="path/to/dependencies.js"></script>
    <script>
        function testFunction() {
            // Test specific functionality
            const result = someFunction();
            document.getElementById('results').innerHTML += 
                `<div>${result ? '‚úì' : '‚úó'} Test result</div>`;
        }
        testFunction();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Workflow Simulation Test
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Workflow Test</title></head>
<body>
    <div id="workflow"></div>
    <script src="path/to/dependencies.js"></script>
    <script>
        function simulateWorkflow() {
            // Step 1: Initialize
            // Step 2: Perform actions
            // Step 3: Verify results
            // Step 4: Document outcomes
        }
        simulateWorkflow();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
